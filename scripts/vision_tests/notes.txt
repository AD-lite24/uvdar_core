            In the experiment description, we use local metric coordinate system with [0,0] roughly in the center of the given area

Sequence set L12 used (most experiments):

    - numbered from 0 to 11, UAV number is one higher (e.g. UAV6 carried sequence 5)

Default exposure was 1000

In experiments with observation from UAVs, the left UV camera was always used

Exposure tests:
  Location: shithole
  Time: ~17:00 local time
  Platforms: UAV7 (closer to sun) and UAV5

  the original plan of varying the output power of the target LEDs was not achieved due to technical issues - we have replaced this by varyin the exposure time of the observer's UV camera

  flights were cca. 4 min each
  Framerate in recordings may be flaky sometimes - I suggest eliminating portions of the recordings that are detected to have less than the desired 60Hz on the camera topics.
  Use topic [rtk_raw] for precise odometry based on differential GPS
  Sun was setting over the course of the experiments - this led to decreased solar UV over time unfortunately
  Video
    sideways
    order of vids : 100 200 500 1000 2000 3000 5000
    shorter than actual flights (just to illustrate conditions)
    marked with hand signs

Spatial separability (same power)
  Location: shithole
  Time: later evening - sun has set, minarets have started to sing
  Platforms: UAV5 and UAV9 -targets (heading = 45 deg), UAV7 -observer (heading = left cam dir)
  distances are different from the original document, due to the mutual distance of 3m not being safe under the conditions:
    targets placed away from sun
    targets 5 m from each other, 45 degs rotated w.r.t. original spec (-11.768, -1.768 UAV5; -8.232, +1.768, UAV9 ), (center at -10, 0) - this was to make them appear closer in the image to the original desired perpendicular layout with 3m distance
    distances (3m was ommitted): 5 7 10 15 18 meters (negative in coords: -17, -20, -25, -28) from the center point between the two target UAVs

Spatial separability (different power)
  Location: shithole

  Flights were cca. 4 min each

  Split into two attempts

  distances are modified in the same way as in the (same power) experiment, the closer target was changing distance together with the observer

  The closest distance (5m) was recorded only briefly, due to it being already represented in the (same power) experiments

  1st attempt:
    Platforms: UAV5 and UAV9 -targets (heading = 45 deg), UAV7 -observer (heading = left cam dir)

    targets were away from sun w.r.t. the observer 
    targets 5 m from each other, 45 degs rotated wrt original spec (-11.768, -1.768 UAV5; -8.232, +1768, UAV9 ), (center at -10, 0)
    target UAV5 at [-11.768, -1.768] was shifting x together with UAV7
    [UAV 9 and 5] - died in action (likely due to temperature-induced altimeter malfunction), ending the 1st attempt

  2nd attempt:
    Platforms: UAV 6 7 8 (uav7 is observer, -11.768 init is UAV6), same layout as in the 1st attempt
    Time: 9:00 onwards, extreme heat (~46 Celsius), sun is ~above and slightly in the direction of the targets

    distances (omitting 3): 5 7 10 15 18 meters (negative in coords: -17, -20, -25, -28) from the initial centerpoint [-10,0] of the targets 
    we are shifting the closer one (UAV6) together with the observer (UAV7), keeping distance of 3,232 in X same as in 1st attempt
    
    positions recorded with RTK (found in the corresponding ROS topic), but not maintained with it - real position shifts from the setpoints due to raw GPS drift, but we know how much
    due to  oscillations in Z (laser rangefinder fails in these conditions), at distances of 15 and 18 m (two last runs) - height is maintained based on barometer as opposed to laser rangefinder as before - this may lead to different absolute height than before
    for 15 meters distance we only have 3 minutes due to hardware failure 


Maximum detection capability:
  Location: small dunes
  Recorded from an independent swarm experiment,
  Recording device was laptop with UV camera (not UAV), placed on the ground
  ~8-9 UAVs, sequences 0-9 from the L12 set


Tracking
  Location: shithole
  Time: ~9:15 onwards
  Platforms: UAV7 - observer, UAV6 - target (and L12 is sequence 5)

  since we don't fly on RTK here, we are unwilling to have 3m proximity - I have scaled the trajectory up w.r.t. the original document:
  closest distance (in Y) was 5m
  the motion of the target was from -13.8333 to +13.8333 in X from the closest position to the observer - the coordinates set to the target UAV were shifted to X = -0.333333 to -28; Y = 0  due to the area size limitations
  the observer was static, at X=-14.166666, Y=+5
  heading of the observer was -2.79253 rad ((-70)-90 = -160deg) , heading of the target is -45 deg to see 3 markers at the nearest position.
  speed of the target was at maximum 4.4 m/s.
  unfortunately, in this experiment we have no RTK due to worsening technical difficulties near the end of our stay in UAE - raw GPS can be used as a relatively reliable source of information on the speed of the target, but precise position is not available

  each of the three flights was 4 minutes long
  Order of signals as they were recorded is L12, L8, L4
  Signals:  L12 = [0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1]
            L8  = [0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]
            L4  = [0,1,1,1]
